# Typing-Speed-Test

A speed typing test is an online tool that measures how many words per minute (WPM) a person can type accurately. The test usually involves typing a given passage of text for a specified amount of time, typically one to three minutes. The test measures the number of words typed during the given time and calculates the typing speed in words per minute.
Speed typing tests are straightforward to use. You visit an online typing test tool, select a test, and start typing the provided text. As you type, the tool records your keystrokes and calculates your WPM and accuracy based on the number of correct words typed within a specified time frame. The test results are displayed at the end, giving you a clear picture of your performance.
